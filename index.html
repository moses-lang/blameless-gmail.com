        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Yangani Secondary School is located in the Bidibidi refugee settlement in Uganda. It was established as part of the Lasting Education Achievements Responding to Needs (LEARN) project, which was funded by the Bureau of Population, 
        Refugees, and Migration (BPRM). The school was constructed by Finn Church Aid (FCA) to address the lack of secondary education opportunities in the area. The initiative aimed to provide inclusive and equitable education for both refugees 
        and the host community. The school includes modern facilities such as classroom blocks, staff accommodations, an administration block, a library, and sanitation facilities. These efforts have significantly improved access to quality education in the region.
        Yangani Secondary School is located in Odravu, within Aringa County, in Yumbe District, Northern Uganda. This region is part of the West Nile Sub-Region, known for its efforts to provide education to both refugees and the host community. 
        The school plays a vital role in fostering learning and development in this area.</p>
